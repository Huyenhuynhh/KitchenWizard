# KitchenWizard
A web application that is designed to make meal preparation easier and more exciting. It allows users to input ingredients they have on hand, and, like a culinary crystal ball, the application presents a range of delicious recipes they can create with those ingredients.

## Technical Stacks:
Backend: Python and Django
Frontend: React.js
Database: MongoDB
Other: Spoonacular API, Docker for containerization, AWS for deployment

## Key Features:
**User Authentication:** Users can create their own account to save their favorite recipes, rate them, and leave comments.

**Ingredient Input:** Users enter the ingredients they have, which the application uses to search for matching recipes.

**Recipe Display:** The application displays a list of recipes that use the provided ingredients. Each recipe comes with detailed cooking instructions, required ingredients (with measures), and a picture.

**Favorites and Rating System:** Users can save their favorite recipes for easy future access. They can also rate recipes.

**Social Sharing:** Users can share their favorite recipes on social media platforms.

**Fridge Inventory:** Users can keep track of their 'fridge' in the application, updating it as they use ingredients or add more.
